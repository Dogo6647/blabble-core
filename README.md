## IMPORTANT
Please, for the sake of socks, open-source your forks as well. (just realized it rhymes lmao)
If you do not, you'll be commiting something very illegal called GPL Violation. Any malicious 
modification of the app using Blabble's vanilla servers (open-sourced or not) will be reported 
and kicked out of them.
