Source code for Blabble, a simple and open-source IM app.

## IMPORTANT
Please, for the sake of socks, open-source your forks as well. (just realized it rhymes lmao)
If you do not, you'll be commiting something called GPL Violation. Any malicious modification
of the app using Blabble's vanilla servers (open-sourced or not) will be reported and kicked 
out of them. By default, this repo doesn't set the vanilla servers at build time for obvious 
security reasons.
